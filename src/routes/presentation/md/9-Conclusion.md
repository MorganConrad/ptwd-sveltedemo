## Mainly vs. React of course

### Quotes from Svelte Proponents

[Josh Collingsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com)

 "React isn’t great at anything except being popular.  React has aged ... poorly"

 "React will be larger and slower than just about anything that’s come since."

 "Nobody ever got fired for choosing React"

 "Svelte hews as closely to the web platform as possible, so even though it’s incredibly powerful, its concepts will be largely familiar."


[Syntax.fm, "The Svelte + SvelteKit Show #669"](https://syntax.fm/show/669/the-svelte-sveltekit-show/transcript)

 "Most of the the straight up JavaScript ecosystem works ... just use the DOM as you as you typically would"

 "You don't have to use the React way of doing things. You can just do the _web way_ of doing things"

 "Templating in Svelte is very similar to how you would template in a normal thing. (e.g. Handlebars) You Just use curly brackets. You put your variables in there."
