## Sveltekit - a Framework for building web application in Svelte

"SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. If you're coming from React, SvelteKit is similar to Next. If you're coming from Vue, SvelteKit is similar to Nuxt."

 [Generally works with web standards](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/web-standards)

 ### More like Next / Nuxt

 - filesystem-based routing
 - SSR (or CSR)
 - data loading
 - scoped CSS
 - page-specific rendering modes
 - offline support

### Replaces "Sapper", with some breaking changes and confusions...


### Advantages
