## Sveltekit - a Framework for building web application in Svelte

"SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. If you're coming from React, SvelteKit is similar to Next. If you're coming from Vue, SvelteKit is similar to Nuxt."

"a meta-framework to build full-stack web applications with Svelte."

 [Generally works with web standards](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/web-standards)

 ### Much like Next / Nuxt

 - filesystem-based routing
 - SSR (or CSR)
 - data loading
 - scoped CSS
 - page-specific rendering modes
 - offline support

### Replaces "Sapper", with some breaking changes and confusions...

 - SvelteKit 1.0 released December 2022


### There is also a Svelte Native
